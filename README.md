# SG
##Problem 1
 Given a list of people with their birth and end years (all between 1900 and 2000), find the year with the most number of people alive.

From the SG/Problem1 directory run:
```
php src/ages.php
```
I left the output simple so that it could be adapted to a service easily

###Test

I could not get PHPUnit working on my mac, so I added a simple test file.

From the SG/Problem1 directory run:
```
php test/yearMostAliveTest.php
```
